			<h4>Me</h4>
			<p>I was born in <b> Mexicali Baja California</b>, but for a while I lived in Guadalajara Jalisco, I returned to Mexicali to study engineering, and currently I work as a <ins><b><i>teacher</i></b></ins>.

		</li>

			<h4>My Hobbies</h4>	
			<p>	Among my <ins>hobbies</ins> is traveling, and thanks to my work I have had the opportunity to visit many cities in my country, among them the ones I have liked the most are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>1<sup>st</sup> <ins>Toluca</ins></li>
				<li>2<sup>nd</sup> <ins>Mexico City</ins></li>

			</ul>
			<p>I have also been able to travel with my wife and one of the trips we enjoyed the most was visiting the <mark><i>pyramids of Teotihuacan and Acapulco</i></mark>. As Mexicali is a border city, visiting the U.S. is something common, particularly going to <ins>Calexico</ins>, El <ins></ins>, <ins>Yuma</ins> and <ins>San Diego</ins>, however I have also been able to visit other cities in the U.S. a little further away, such as <b><i>Chicago</i></b>, <b><i>St. Louis Missouri</i></b> and <b><i>Seattle</i></b>.</p>
